                <p>
                    Dishcovery originally started not as a business, but as a group of friends sharing food.

                    <i>"I'm too tired to cook today. I need to cook both vegetables and chicken with the rice!"</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <i>"Well, what about you make some extra chicken, I'll cook the vegetables, and we'll take half of
                        each?"</i>

                    <i>Who's chicken should I buy today?</i>
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Wow, I made $10 today just by making a larger quantity of the chicken I would've cooked
                        anyways!</i>

            Now, we've properly established as a business. From the comfort of your home, you can order delicious and
            quality home-made food from your neighbours. We've made it easy for you to order food from your local
            households, and we've made it easy for the home chefs to make money from their cooking, without spending any
            extra effort!
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is that everyone can effortlessly make money from their cooking, without the hassle associated with
            setting up a restaurant. You can either cook part of your meal and purchase the rest from our many
            restaurants,
            or you can purchase the entire meal yourself. It's up to you!
        </p>
        <p>
            Do note that there is no delivery service, so you will have to pick up your food from the home chef's house.
