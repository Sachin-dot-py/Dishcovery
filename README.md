## How It Works

Homecooks can sign up, create profiles, and update their daily menus with full dietary details. Buyers can then browse nearby homecooks, check out their menus, and place orders. 
The system automatically sends email notifications for order placements, status updates, and cancellations, and generates a detailed invoice for each order.
